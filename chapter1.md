## Importing the Data

```yaml
type: NormalExercise

xp: NaN

key: 3938a0ce13
```

We always begin the data science pipeline by asking a **question**. This question is what defines what we want to solve, or understand from the data.  However, we first need to take a see and explore our data.

`@instructions`
We have three data files: 

- CR1000_OneHour.xlsx
- CR1000_OneMin.xlsx
- CR1000_FifteenSec.xlsx


Importing data in  **R** is very simple when using prepackaged libraries.
